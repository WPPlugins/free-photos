 Description: The current version of the "Free Photos" plugin from Fotoglif has reached end of life and no longer functions with the www.fotoglif.com site. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Fotoglif is embarking on a new and exciting upgrade to our business. We will be going live with a new website in the coming days, including the ability to license and download images as well as retaining the option to embed ad-supported images. We are working with many of the world's leading producers of great pictures to significantly expand the depth and breadth of our offering. We are also working on a new WordPress plugin and will update the current version as soon as possible. For those of you who have used this plugin in the past, we thank you for your support and look forward to providing you with an updated version soon. If you have questions, or would like to be alerted when the new version is ready, please drop us an email at support@fotoglif.com . Regards, The Fotoglif Team.
